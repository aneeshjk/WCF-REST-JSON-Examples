# SETUP
Open the .sln file in VS2010.  You should be able to run it in debug and it will start listening on port 80.

Open the WebClient/index.html file in your browser.  You may need to set this up as a local IIS virtual directory so that it's http://localhost and not file://localhost.

Click some buttons and see what happens.

Enjoy!
